// Valid states are:
// "pre":        This is a pre alpha state, means the development on this branch has just begun.
// "a1".."aN":   Alpha versions. Early public testing versions, often unstable.
// "b1".."bN":   Beta versions. Quite stable but there may be some feature changes in the future.
// "rc1".."rcN": Release candidate versions. Feature complete.
//
//  Release versions have NO literals appended!
